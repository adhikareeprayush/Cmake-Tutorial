## A Basic Starting Point

In this step, we will learn CMake's basic syntax, commands, and variables. Along the way, we will create a simple project through three exercises. Each exercise is structured as follows:

### Exercise Structure

1. **Goal**
2. **Helpful Resources**
3. **Files to Edit**
4. **Getting Started**
5. **Build and Run**
6. **Solution**

### Where Do I Start with CMake?

This step will provide an introduction to some of CMake's basic syntax, commands, and variables. As these concepts are introduced, we will work through three exercises to create a simple CMake project.

Each exercise will begin with some background information, followed by a goal and a list of helpful resources. Each file in the "Files to Edit" section is in the Step1 directory and contains one or more TODO comments. Each TODO represents a line or two of code to change or add. The TODOs are intended to be completed in numerical order: first complete TODO 1, then TODO 2, and so on.

The "Getting Started" section will give some helpful hints and guide you through the exercise. The "Build and Run" section will walk you step-by-step through how to build and test the exercise. Finally, at the end of each exercise, the intended solution is discussed.

Also note that each step in the tutorial builds on the previous one. For example, the starting code for Step 2 is the complete solution to Step 1.
